Edwin was one of the leaders for a group that worked on a complex data survey to work with my data software tool for webmasters. The team in particular was given 4 to 5 projects that I gave and without hesitation they all chose the hardest project and the one I hoped they could make progress on.\n\nTheir research and reports are now being used by my programming team to implement a solution they came up with. The team impressed me with how fast they were able to learn about the affiliate marketing industry that I work in and it was important for them to understand it to be able to work on the project.\n\nEdwin took a lot of initiative in the group as he wasn't shy to ask questions. He had just as much initiative and ideas when coming up with solutions on the spot within our team meetings\n\nI am ecstatic I had this group of students to work with and Edwin in particular brought a lot of ideas and solutions that lead the group in the right direction. The team's work will accelerate this data survey project and Edwin did an amazing job!",
